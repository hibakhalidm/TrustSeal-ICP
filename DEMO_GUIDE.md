## Overview
TrustSeal ICP is a decentralized credential verification system built on the Internet Computer Protocol. This demo showcases the complete workflow from user registration to credential verification with proper admin oversight.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) ✅ Installed
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) ✅ Installed

### Quick Start
1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```batch
   setup-demo.bat
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 👥 User Roles & Demo Credentials

### 🔐 Administrator
**Purpose:** Verify and manage issuers, oversee the entire system
**Demo Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `trustseal2025`

### 🏫 Issuer (Educational Institution)
**Purpose:** Mint and manage academic credentials
**Registration:** Requires IC Identity authentication

### 🔍 Checker (Employer/Verifier)
**Purpose:** Verify credentials for hiring decisions
**Registration:** Requires IC Identity authentication

## 📋 Demo Workflow

### Step 1: Administrator Login
1. Click **"Admin Login"** on the welcome screen
2. Enter credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `trustseal2025`
3. Access the Admin Dashboard to:
   - View system statistics
   - Verify pending issuer registrations
   - Manage user accounts
   - Monitor credential activity

### Step 2: User Registration (IC Identity Required)
1. Click **"Register Now"** on the welcome screen
2. **Important:** You must first connect your Internet Identity
   - Click **"Connect IC Identity First"**
   - In demo mode, this creates a mock IC identity
3. After IC authentication, complete registration as:
   - **Issuer:** Educational institution that mints credentials
   - **Checker:** Employer/verifier that validates credentials

### Step 3: Issuer Workflow
1. **Login with IC Identity**
2. **Access Issuer Dashboard:**
   - View issued credentials count
   - Manage active/revoked credentials
   - Track institution verification status
3. **Mint New Credentials:**
   - Enter student information
   - Specify credential type (Bachelor's, Master's, PhD, Certificate)
   - Set institution name and issue date
   - Mint NFT-based credential
4. **Credential Management:**
   - View all issued credentials
   - Revoke credentials if necessary
   - Track credential status

### Step 4: Checker Workflow
1. **Login with IC Identity**
2. **Access Checker Dashboard:**
   - View verification statistics
   - Track organization details
   - Monitor verification history
3. **Verify Credentials:**
   - Enter Token ID provided by student/candidate
   - View detailed credential information
   - Verify authenticity and revocation status
   - Export verification results

### Step 5: Credential Verification Process
1. **For Students/Graduates:**
   - Receive Token ID from issuing institution
   - Share Token ID with potential employers
   - Credentials are stored as NFTs on blockchain

2. **For Employers:**
   - Enter Token ID in verification section
   - Instantly verify:
     - Student name and credential type
     - Issuing institution
     - Issue date and validity
     - Revocation status
     - Blockchain proof of authenticity

## 🔑 Key Features Demonstrated

### 🔒 Security Features
- **IC Identity Authentication:** All registrations tied to unique IC identities
- **Admin Verification:** Issuers must be verified by administrators
- **Blockchain Immutability:** Credentials cannot be forged or altered

### 🌐 Decentralized Benefits
- **No Central Authority:** Verification doesn't require contacting institutions
- **Global Access:** Works anywhere with internet connection
- **Instant Verification:** Real-time credential validation
- **Tamper-Proof Records:** Blockchain-based storage prevents fraud

### 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Admin Dashboard:**
  - System-wide statistics
  - User management
  - Issuer verification
  - Credential monitoring

- **Issuer Dashboard:**
  - Credential minting interface
  - Issued credentials tracking
  - Revocation management
  - Institution verification status

- **Checker Dashboard:**
  - Credential verification tools
  - Verification history
  - Organization profile
  - Statistics and analytics

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript
- **Internet Computer Agent** for blockchain interaction
- **Internet Identity** for authentication
- **Webpack** for bundling

### Backend (Simulated)
- **Motoko** smart contracts (simulated in demo)
- **DIP721** NFT standard compliance
- **IC Canister** architecture

### Blockchain Integration
- **Internet Computer Protocol** for decentralized hosting
- **NFT-based** credential storage
- **Principal-based** identity management

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For full production deployment:
1. Install DFX SDK
2. Deploy Internet Identity canister
3. Deploy TrustSeal backend canister
4. Configure production environment variables
5. Build and deploy frontend to IC

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build Errors:** Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Port Conflicts:** Change port in webpack.config.js if 3000 is occupied
- **Authentication Issues:** Clear browser cache and restart development server

### Demo Mode Notes
- This demo uses simulated blockchain interactions for demonstration purposes
- In production, all operations would interact with actual IC canisters
- IC Identity is mocked in development mode for easier demonstration
