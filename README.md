- **ICP Local**: http://localhost:4943 (DFX replica)
- **Frontend Canister**: http://localhost:8080/?canisterId=<canister-id>
- **DFX Status**: `dfx ping local` (check replica health)

### Demo Fallback Options
- **Option 1**: Use demo server (`npm run demo:dev`) for reliable presentations
- **Option 2**: Show screenshots and code walkthrough if technical issues
- **Option 3**: Use pre-recorded demo video for backup presentation
